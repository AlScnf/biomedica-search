# Biomedical Image Search Engine 🧠🔬  
> Search biomedical images using image upload or natural language queries. Powered by CLIP, FAISS, and Gradio.

---

## 🚀 What it does

This app allows users to retrieve biomedical images based on:

- 🖼 **Visual similarity** — Upload an image and find others that look like it
- 💬 **Text prompts** — Type descriptions like "lung carcinoma" or "pink-stained cells" to search by meaning

It uses **zero-shot learning** via OpenAI's CLIP model to embed both images and text into a common vector space, and **FAISS** to return the top-k most similar images from a curated dataset (PathMNIST, 9-class histopathology).

---

## 💡 Why it matters

Biomedical professionals often search large image datasets visually or semantically:

- A **clinician** might want to see cases similar to one they’re analyzing  
- A **student** might want examples of specific cell structures  
- A **researcher** might want to explore patterns across labeled images

This tool makes that kind of exploration **instant** and **multimodal**.

## 🧠 Powered by

- **CLIP** (Contrastive Language–Image Pre-training) for vision-language embeddings
- **FAISS** for fast, scalable similarity search
- **Gradio** for a beautiful and interactive UI
- **PathMNIST** as the working dataset (upgradeable to BIOMEDICA or custom sets)

---

## ✍️ Example usage

> Upload: a microscopic slide of stained epithelial cells  
> Output: top-5 similar images from the dataset

> Input: `"microscopic blood smear with nucleus"`  
> Output: 5 images that match the text semantically

## 🔮 Roadmap

This is just the start. Future extensions may include:
- Caption + label display for retrieved images
- Real clinical datasets (e.g., BIOMEDICA)
- Hybrid text + image queries
- Deployment to hospitals or research labs as internal tooling
